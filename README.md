Python and C++ implementations for Black Scholes call/put value calculation and normal distribution simulation comparisons

Python file calculates the value of simulated call and put options using the Black Scholes algorithm. This same functionality is also implemented in C++

C++ implementation includes a comparison of European and American Option values simulated with normally distrubed outcomes.
